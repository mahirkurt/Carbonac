  "description": "Horizontal band displaying 3-5 icon-and-stat pairs in a single row, combining simple iconography with numeric highlights and short labels. Used as a visual break between narrative sections to reinforce key metrics or concepts at a glance.",
  "grid": {

    "verticalAlignment": "center",
    "margins": "$spacing-09 (48px) above/below strip, internal items spaced equally"
  },
  "components": [
    "PatternBlock(infographic-strip) as root container with g10 or $blue-10 background",
    "Stat items (3-5 repeated): icon + number + label grouping",
    "Icon: Carbon pictogram (32px) or custom SVG in $blue-60, centered above the stat",
    "Stat number: $display-01 in $text-01, the primary visual element",
    "Stat label: $label-01 in $text-03, 2-4 words max below the number",
    "Divider lines: optional 1px $ui-03 vertical separators between items",
    "Background: full-width $ui-01 (g10) or $blue-10 band for visual differentiation"
  ],
  "rules": [
    "Minimum 3, maximum 5 items — fewer looks sparse, more becomes a KPI grid (use that pattern instead)",
    "All items must have the same structure: icon + number + label — no mixing text-only with icon items",
    "Icons use Carbon pictograms at 32px — consistent size and style across all items in the strip",
    "Stat numbers use $display-01 — the dominant visual element, numbers should be the first thing scanned",
    "Labels use $label-01 in $text-03 — secondary information, 2-4 words maximum",
    "Full-width background band ($ui-01 or $blue-10) differentiates the strip from surrounding white body content",
    "Equal horizontal spacing between all items — use CSS flexbox with justify-content: space-around",
    "Strip must not break across pages — entire band is a single visual unit"
