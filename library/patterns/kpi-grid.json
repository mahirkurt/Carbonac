    "Metric value: $display-01 for the primary number, $text-01 color",
    "Metric unit: $label-01 inline or superscript for unit/suffix (%, USD, etc.)",

  "rules": [
    "Maximum 6 KPIs — more than 6 on one grid loses scannability; split into two grids if needed",
    "Optimal count is 3-4 KPIs for A4; use 4/4/4/4 (4-col) or 5/5/6 (3-col) internal sub-grid",
    "Metric value uses $display-01 — this is the largest element in the grid and the primary visual anchor",
    "Caption uses $label-01 in $text-03 — de-emphasized but readable, max 3 words",
    "Use g10 theme for the entire grid to create visual separation from surrounding content",
    "Internal spacing between KPI cards is $spacing-05 (16px) — tight enough to read as a group",
