    "Survey question heading: $heading-03 in $text-01, displaying the exact survey question",
    "Chart container: CarbonChart (horizontal-bar, donut, or stacked-bar), 10 columns wide",
    "Response labels: $body-short-01 in $text-02 on chart axis or legend",
    "Percentage values: $heading-04 or $label-02 bold in $text-01 displayed on/near bars",
    "Legend panel: right-aligned 4-column area with color swatches + labels in $label-01",

  "rules": [
    "Survey question is displayed verbatim as $heading-03 — never paraphrase or abbreviate the actual question",
    "Horizontal bar charts are preferred for single-select questions — easier to read than vertical bars for text labels",
    "Donut charts only for questions with 2-4 response options — more segments make donut unreadable",
    "Percentage values must be displayed directly on or adjacent to each bar/segment — never force readers to estimate from axis",
    "Color palette follows Carbon categorical sequence: $blue-60, $teal-50, $purple-60, $magenta-50, $cyan-50",
    "Sample size (n=) footnote is mandatory — placed bottom-left of chart in $label-01 $text-05",
    "Maximum one survey chart per half-page — two charts per page only if vertically stacked with clear separation",
